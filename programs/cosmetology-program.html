              Though no cosmetology program can be entirely online due to the
              practical nature of the profession, MSBBA offers a

              live webinars, recorded sessions, and in-person training. Our

          and professionalism needed to excel in the competitive beauty

          experience. This blend of online learning and practical training helps
          students build confidence and competence in the field.
